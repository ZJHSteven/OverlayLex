    "Speech Bubbles are more of a chat-system than a post-it message, and is likely better suited to the style of game that wants to have more RP-based chats. If you have 'View on Send' checked, you will also see the resulting speech bubble pop up on the token it was sent from. There are some things to note in how it's used;": "",
