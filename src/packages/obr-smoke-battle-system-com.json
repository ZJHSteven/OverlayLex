    ". UVTT Files have the .uvtt extension (Though some may differ depending on the application the VTT they were designed for). Smoke&Spectre can accept general UVTT scenes as well as ones configured for Foundry (more may be added in the future). When importing a scene, you will be asked where you want to import the Map to in your OBR storage - and the rest will handled for you. For the other types, it generally expects the map to already be within the scene - so select the map from the Alignment dropdown, and then import your file. It may take some trial and error depending on the DPI of the map (Not all files are made the same!). Owlbear's default DPI is 150 per grid unit.": "。 UVTT 文件具有 .uvtt 扩展名（尽管有些文件可能会有所不同，具体取决于它们设计的 VTT 应用程序）。 Smoke&Spectre 可以接受一般 UVTT 场景以及为 Foundry 配置的场景（将来可能会添加更多场景）。导入场景时，系统会询问您要将地图导入到 OBR 存储中的哪个位置 - 其余的将为您处理。对于其他类型，它通常期望地图已经位于场景内 - 因此从“对齐”下拉列表中选择地图，然后导入文件。根据地图的 DPI，可能需要一些尝试和错误（并非所有文件都相同！）。 Owlbear 的默认 DPI 为每网格单位 150。",
